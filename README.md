<h2>Course Project</h2>
Below, a course's project, along with its outcome, and path to be found are detailed.
<h3 id="AP">Application Project</h3>
Unstructured datasets such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-de">genres</a>, <a href="https://genius.com">lyrics</a>, and users' <a href="https://www.last.fm/de/home">tags</a>, were processed via NLP approaches. Preprocessing steps were implemented in accordance with overarching NLP concepts. Concepts as manifested in pre-trained fastText for static genre embeddings. As NRCLex for lexical emotions and sentiments as well as trained Doc2vec for contextualized word embeddings, as in the case of lyrics. Contrasting to TF-IDF (a count-based approach) for users' tags. Results were complemented by sonic, scored via a CBRS. A CBRS, composed of cosine similarities and Euclidean distances, weighted by features. The CBRS was deployed online via Flask. Spotify previews were accessible on search. A substitute assistant for <a href="https://www.80s80s.de">Radio 80s80s</a>' music planners and moderators was therefore furnished under this <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/application_project">project</a>.
<h3 id="DVVA">Data Visualization and Visual Analytics (DVVA)</h3>
Multi-structural datasets pertaining to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> (innovative) and <a href="https://www.chegg.com">Chegg Inc.</a> (traditional) were preprocessed, allowing for data journalism. Throughout the data journalism <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/data_visualization">project</a>, preprocessed data was analyzed for sentiment among platforms of the e-learning vertical, and visually presented. This <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/data_visualization">project</a> therefore gave insight into the future delivery of education by means of indicators, thus assisting with the navigation of the e-learning sector on financial markets. 
<h3 id="ML">Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
A dataset comprised of musical features associated with songs on <a href="https://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>, as labeled by a user's likes and dislikes was preprocessed and exposed to initial as well as explanatory analysis. In the course of the classification <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/ml_classification">project</a>, models were trained on that preprocessed data, employing "K-Nearest-Neighbor", "Decision Trees", and "Support Vector Machines", tuned for its hyperparameters, and nested cross-validated. Based on the <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/ml_classification">project</a> findings recommendations as to a model, curating as yet unseen songs to stimulate user engagement, have been proposed.
<h3 id="MMS">Mathematics and Multivariate Statistics (MMS)</h3>
Datasets containing transactional features of users within <a href="https://www.instacart.com">Instacart's</a> grocery vertical have been preprocessed and analyzed initially as well as explanatorily. For the purpose of this <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/ml_clustering">project</a>, "k-Means" and "hierarchical" clustering were applied to PCA-prepared preprocessed data. User behavior was then characterized according to the selected cluster's analysis, enabling predictive marketing to foster engagement via personalized strategies.
<h3 id="PTDS">Tools and Programming Languages for Data Science (PTDS)</h3>
A Python module for streamlining <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home">World Bank</a> data retrieval has been designed as part of the <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/application_programming_interface">project</a>. The module interfaces with the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home">World Bank</a> API, through parameterized queries, encompassing input variables such as "country code", "indicator", and "year". Resulting data is tidied, and returned as a pandas DataFrame by the module, as a foundation for advanced data science endeavors.
