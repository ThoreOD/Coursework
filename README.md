  Course Project
</h2>
Below, a course's project, along with its outcome, and path to be found are detailed.

  Data Visualization and Visual Analytics (DVVA)
</h3>
Multi-structural datasets pertaining to ChatGPT (innovative) and Chegg Inc. (traditional) were preprocessed, allowing for data journalism. Throughout the data journalism <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/data_visualization">project</a>, preprocessed data was analyzed for sentiment among platforms of the e-learning vertical, and visually presented. This <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/data_visualization">project</a> therefore gave insight into the future delivery of education by means of indicators, thus assisting with the navigation of the e-learning sector on financial markets. 
<h3 id="ML">
  Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
</h3>
A dataset comprised of musical features associated with songs on Spotify, as labeled by a user's likes and dislikes was preprocessed and exposed to initial as well as explanatory analysis. In the course of the classification <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/ml_classification">project</a>, models were trained on that preprocessed data, employing "K-Nearest-Neighbor", "Decision Trees", and "Support Vector Machines", tuned for its hyperparameters, and nested cross-validated. Based on the <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/ml_classification">project</a> findings recommendations as to a model, curating as yet unseen songs to stimulate user engagement, have been proposed.
