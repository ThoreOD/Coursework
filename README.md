<h2>Course Project</h2>
Below, a course's project, along with its outcome, and path to be found are detailed.
<h3 id="DVVA">Data Visualization and Visual Analytics (DVVA)</h3>
Multi-structural datasets pertaining to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> (innovative) and <a href="https://www.chegg.com">Chegg Inc.</a> (traditional) were preprocessed, allowing for data journalism. Throughout the data journalism <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/data_visualization">project</a>, preprocessed data was analyzed for sentiment among platforms of the e-learning vertical, and visually presented. This <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/data_visualization">project</a> therefore gave insight into the future delivery of education by means of indicators, thus assisting with the navigation of the e-learning sector on financial markets. 
<h3 id="ML">Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
A dataset comprised of musical features associated with songs on <a href="https://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>, as labeled by a user's likes and dislikes was preprocessed and exposed to initial as well as explanatory analysis. In the course of the classification <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/ml_classification">project</a>, models were trained on that preprocessed data, employing "K-Nearest-Neighbor", "Decision Trees", and "Support Vector Machines", tuned for its hyperparameters, and nested cross-validated. Based on the <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/ml_classification">project</a> findings recommendations as to a model, curating as yet unseen songs to stimulate user engagement, have been proposed.
<h3 id="MMS">Mathematics and Multivariate Statistics (MMS)</h3>
Datasets containing transactional features of users within <a href="https://www.instacart.com">Instacart's</a> grocery vertical have been preprocessed and analyzed initially as well as explanatorily. For the purpose of this <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/ml_clustering">project</a>, "k-Means" and "hierarchical" clustering were applied to PCA-prepared preprocessed data. User behavior was then characterized according to the selected cluster's analysis, enabling predictive marketing to foster engagement via personalized strategies.
<h3 id="PTDS">Tools and Programming Languages for Data Science (PTDS)</h3>
A Python module for streamlining <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home">World Bank</a> data retrieval has been designed as part of the <a href="https://github.com/thore-dahl/Coursework/tree/main/application_programming_interface">project</a>. The module interfaces with the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home">World Bank</a> API, through parameterized queries, encompassing input variables such as "country code", "indicator", and "year". Resulting data is tidied, and returned as a pandas DataFrame by the module, as a foundation for advanced data science endeavors.
